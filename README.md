# MarbleMania

MM aims to be a spiritual successor to Marble Madness.

The 1984 classic holds a particular place in my heart; it was also a source of unbridled rage which would make the average Super Meat Boy player blush.

Marble Mania is a 3D third person game built in Unity.

Compared to my other projects, MM represents the extent of the skills & experience I have built up since <a href="https://github.com/ducksplash/moonshot">Winston is Stuck on the Moon</a> and the height within this project is Level 2.

Level 2 was where I finally nailed particles, texturing & modelling, and where I was able to refine my codebase for creating and destroying objects on the fly (for the volcanic eruptions).

The eagle eyed will be able to see the difference between the Level 1 and Level 2 screen shots; 
On the left, very little texturing on surfaces (except the hand) - this is using Unity's in-built texture mapping.
On the right, texturing everywhere; these textures are added with Substance Painter.

Level 3 has had more work done on it that it appears; that shark tank was a f****** nightmare; the shark just kept floating away, and the fix was MATHS.
The other time sink was getting that Pirate to follow the player, fire at the player, crash into the player - but not flip over, row backwards, float away or tilt (as he very much wanted to!) - By contrast, making the player itself get in a boat and row it took about half an hour.
Just like before, mathematics came to save the day. So to anyone who says "YoU cAn Be A GaMe DeV WiThOuT MaThS" - EFF OFF :P

MM has been a labour of love thus far - even for a 3 level demo, I have easily sunk 1,000 hours into this approximately 13GB project (I need to optimise a LOT during polish stage!), mainly making models and doing textures with my favourite part - writing the code - taking the least amount of time.

The plan was to have the demo out before October, but I started a new job and my studies started to heat up again, so this has been rescheduled for June 2022 (studies go off-season in May so i'll have my evenings back!).

The decision to continue the game after the demo will be determined by the audience - if there is one at all :P
